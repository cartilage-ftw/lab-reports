	The length of the string taken was $L = 4.0$ m, with linear-density $\mu = 3.2 \times 10^{-3}$ kg m$^{-1}$. A frequency of $125$ Hz was input. Tension was varied by varying the load in the container.
	
	The values measured were as follows
	
	\begin{table}[h]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
			\hline
			Tension (T) & Number of half-cycles ($N$) & $\lambda = 2L/N$ & Speed ($v$) & Frequency ($f$)\\
			\hline
			16.33 & 14 & 0.57 & 71.45& 125.01\\
			18.93 & 13 &  0.61 & 76.91& 124.98\\
			26.44 & 11 & 0.73 & 90.90 & 124.98\\
			50.00 & 8 & 1.00 & 125.0  & 125.00\\
			65.30 &	7 & 1.14 & 142.85 & 124.99\\
			88.75 & 6 & 1.33 & 166.54 & 124.90\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Observed number of half-$\lambda$ for a given $T$ and corresponding estimates vof Frequency}
	\end{table}
	
	where the speed was calculated using $$ v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$
	and the frequency as $$ f = \frac{v}{\lambda}$$
	
	\section*{Results}
	The average of the measured frequency was $f = 124.98$ Hz, which has a deviation of $0.02$ Hz from the true value (125 Hz).
