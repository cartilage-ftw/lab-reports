# lab-reports

I've incuded the `.tex` files, relevant python scripts that contain the plotting routine, etc.

### Undergrad Labs

Those for which I have lab reports for here, are:
* PHY249 (Analog and Digital Systems Lab)
* PHY247 (Waves and Optics Lab)
* PHY366 (Advanced Electronics)
* PHY350 (Solid State Physics)
* PHY259 (Modern Physics Lab)
* PHY262 (Electromagnetic Theory Lab)
* PHY184 (Testing and Calibration)
* PHY382 (they called it SciLab, although I don't remember being taught that, as should be evident from the reports.)

I took these as an undergraduate at LPU, Phagwara. Due to COVID, they happened virtually. I have included virtual lab links whenever possible.
